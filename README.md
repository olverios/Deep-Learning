# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis 

## Overview of the analysis: 
This project seeks to predict if the behavior of the applicants will be successful, a Deeplearning model is used to determine this requirement.

## Results: 
Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
IS_SUCCESSFUL
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

### Summary: 
They managed to make slight performance improvements, dropping columns, increasing the number of layers with few neurons per layer (deep) and also with a single layer with a high number of neurons.
